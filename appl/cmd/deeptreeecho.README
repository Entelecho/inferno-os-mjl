# Deep Tree Echo State Network Reservoir Computing Framework

## Overview

This framework implements a comprehensive reservoir computing system for Inferno OS that integrates multiple advanced computational paradigms into a unified "Deep Tree Echo Self" architecture.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Deep Tree Echo State Network (ESN)

The core computational unit is a hierarchical Echo State Network with multiple layers:
- **Hierarchical Layers**: Multiple reservoir layers organized in a tree structure
- **Spectral Radius Control**: Maintains dynamic stability at edge of chaos
- **Sparse Connectivity**: Efficient reservoir connections with configurable density
- **Leaking Integration**: Temporal dynamics with configurable leaking rate

### 2. Paun P-System Membrane Computing

Implements bio-inspired membrane computing for reservoir evolution:
- **Hierarchical Membranes**: Nested membrane structures
- **Rewriting Rules**: Object transformation rules
- **Parallel Evolution**: Simultaneous rule application
- **Inter-membrane Communication**: Object transfer between membranes

### 3. Butcher B-Series Rooted Forest Runge-Kutta Integration

Provides numerical integration with:
- **RK4 Integration**: Fourth-order Runge-Kutta method
- **Ridge Regression**: Regularized linear regression for output training
- **Gradient Descent**: Training optimization
- **Temporal Evolution**: Continuous-time dynamics

### 4. Julia J-Surface Elementary Differential Ricci Flow

Implements geometric flow equations:
- **Ricci Tensor Computation**: Curvature tensor calculation
- **Metric Evolution**: dg/dt = -2 * Ric
- **Scalar Curvature**: Global curvature measure
- **Geometric Regularization**: Shape-aware processing

### 5. Differential Emotion Theory Framework

Implements Izard's emotion theory with:
- **Ten Basic Emotions**: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Surprise, Interest, Contempt, Shame, Guilt
- **Emotional Valence**: Positive-negative dimension
- **Emotional Intensity**: Overall activation level
- **Affective Modulation**: Response modulation based on emotional state

### 6. LLM Persona & Character Traits Mapping

Maps personality traits to reservoir parameters:
- **Big Five Traits**: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism
- **Trait-to-Parameter Mapping**: Personality influences network behavior
- **Dynamic Persona**: Configurable character profiles

### 7. Cognitive Attention Mechanism

Implements attention similar to transformer architectures:
- **Query-Key-Value Attention**: Standard attention mechanism
- **Softmax Normalization**: Probabilistic weighting
- **Multi-head Potential**: Extensible to multiple attention heads
- **Context-aware Processing**: Selective focus on relevant information

## Integration: Deep Tree Echo Self

The `DeepTreeEchoSelf` ADT integrates all components:

```limbo
dtes := ref DeepTreeEchoSelf;
dtes.init(depth, layerSizes);
response := dtes.process(input);
```

Processing flow:
1. Input → ESN forward pass
2. Affective processing → Emotional state update
3. Affective modulation → Response modification
4. Attention mechanism → Context-aware output
5. Persona modulation → Trait-influenced response

## Usage

### Module Import

```limbo
include "reservoir.m";
    reservoir: Reservoir;
    DeepTreeEchoSelf, PersonaTrait, EmotionState: import reservoir;

reservoir = load Reservoir Reservoir->PATH;
reservoir->init();
```

### Creating a Model

```limbo
depth := 3;
layerSizes := array[depth] of int;
layerSizes[0] = 50;
layerSizes[1] = 30;
layerSizes[2] = 20;

dtes := ref DeepTreeEchoSelf;
dtes.init(depth, layerSizes);
```

### Processing Input

```limbo
stimulus := array[10] of real;
# Fill stimulus with data
response := dtes.process(stimulus);
```

### Training

```limbo
inputs := array[n_samples] of array of real;
targets := array[n_samples] of array of real;
# Fill training data
dtes.train(inputs, targets);
```

### Setting Persona

```limbo
persona := ref PersonaTrait;
persona.openness = 0.9;
persona.conscientiousness = 0.7;
persona.extraversion = 0.8;
persona.agreeableness = 0.6;
persona.neuroticism = 0.3;

dtes.persona = persona;
```

### Generating Response

```limbo
prompt := array[10] of real;
# Fill prompt
response := dtes.generate_response(prompt);
```

## Command-Line Tool

The `deeptreeecho` command provides interactive demonstrations:

```sh
deeptreeecho [-demo|-train|-persona|-emotion|-help]
```

### Demo Mode (default)
```sh
deeptreeecho -demo
```
Runs a complete demonstration showing:
- System initialization
- Stimulus processing
- Emotional state
- Membrane evolution
- Ricci flow curvature
- Persona traits

### Training Mode
```sh
deeptreeecho -train
```
Demonstrates reservoir training with synthetic data.

### Persona Mode
```sh
deeptreeecho -persona
```
Shows different persona profiles and their effect on responses.

### Emotion Mode
```sh
deeptreeecho -emotion
```
Demonstrates emotional processing with different stimuli.

## Theoretical Background

### Echo State Networks
ESNs use a fixed random recurrent network (the reservoir) with trained output connections. The reservoir projects input into a high-dimensional space where temporal patterns become linearly separable.

### Membrane Computing
P-Systems provide a bio-inspired computational model based on cell membranes. Objects evolve through parallel application of rewriting rules, enabling distributed computation.

### Runge-Kutta Methods
RK methods provide accurate numerical integration of differential equations. The Butcher tableau defines the coefficients for multi-stage integration.

### Ricci Flow
The Ricci flow is a geometric evolution equation that deforms Riemannian metrics. It provides a geometric regularization that can help with manifold learning.

### Differential Emotion Theory
Izard's theory posits discrete basic emotions as fundamental building blocks of emotional experience. Each emotion has adaptive value and distinct neural substrates.

### Big Five Personality Model
The five-factor model (OCEAN) captures major dimensions of personality variation:
- **O**penness: Creativity, curiosity
- **C**onscientiousness: Organization, dependability
- **E**xtraversion: Sociability, energy
- **A**greeableness: Compassion, cooperation
- **N**euroticism: Emotional instability

### Attention Mechanisms
Attention allows models to focus on relevant information through learned query-key-value transformations, enabling context-aware processing.

## Implementation Notes

### Numerical Stability
- Spectral radius kept below 1.0 for stability
- Softmax with max subtraction for numerical stability
- Normalization to prevent overflow

### Performance Considerations
- Sparse connectivity reduces computational cost
- Fixed reservoir weights (only output trained)
- Efficient matrix operations

### Extensibility
The modular design allows:
- Custom activation functions
- Different integration schemes
- Alternative attention mechanisms
- Extended emotion models
